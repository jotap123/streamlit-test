## Project description
This project contains two models that were deployed via API to streamlit and it focuses solely on the deployment part, having only the models in the `model` folder and no scripts generating them. The whole point was to have code that would expose an API for use on streamlit.

The two models can be used in the following links:
heart disease: https://app-test-strmlt-heart.streamlit.app/
Fraud: https://app-test-deploy-strmlt.streamlit.app/
